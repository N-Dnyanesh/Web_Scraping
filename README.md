# Web_Scraping

This Python script scrapes product information (Name, Price, and Rating) from Amazonâ€™s search results page for "laptops". It utilizes the requests library to fetch webpage content and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML. Extracted data is then saved into a CSV file using pandas, ensuring structured storage. The script also includes error handling to skip products with missing details.
